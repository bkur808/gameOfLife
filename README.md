CSCI 154 - SIMULATION PROJECT 1: CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE

Really just started working on this, but I have been going off of a free tutorial I found here. https://realpython.com/conway-game-of-life-python/#demo-conways-game-of-life-with-python

Currently on step 3, here is the code as it stands.

Obviously need to go through, comment, and change some things up as we probably shouldnt just directly copy this project.

But, this gives a good jumping off point for a setup for our other projects. This is pretty similar to the other grid one that was talked about in lecture today 3/19. The disease spread simulation one could work along similar lines to this, just with a predefined grid.

I plan on working on this more throughout the day today - Brian 3/19
